# COVID-19: Detecting face masks with Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV

The COVID-19 mask detector could potentially be used to help ensure safety.
Much after the Lockdown is finished, we'll have to guarantee certain things like social-distancing,masks and so forth.
This project can be used to ensure usage of Masks.

LIB USED : - Keras, tensorflow,Numpy,Matplotlib

Various concepts of Neural Network,Deep Learing and computer vision has been used.
